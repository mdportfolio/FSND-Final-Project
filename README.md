# FSND-Final-Project
## Log Analysis Project
This is my final project for Udacity's Intro to Programming course.

### What you need:
* Vagrant installed 
* Virtual box for Windows installed 

#### How to run the program on Windows:
1. Access git on your computer.
2. Change directories `cd` command
3. When you reach the folder with the Vagrant file, put the `vagrant up` command.
4. Now that you have the VM booted up, put the `winpty vagrant ssh` command.
You should see the `vagrant@vagrant:` prompt. This means that you are in the VM.
5. In the VM, change directories until you reach your file with the queries.
`cd (folder of python file)`
`python (python_file.py)`
